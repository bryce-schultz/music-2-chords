Music2Chords

Adds a button to lookup chords on some platforms.

Supported Platforms:
- Apple Music
- Pandora

Some songs wont work right as the pages aren't very consistant about class names, and id's.

Future plans:
- Better page parsing
- Better song title cleanup functions
- More chord providers or option to use your own
